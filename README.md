# Opendata.ch 10 Year Review

To [celebrate our 10th anniversary](https://10years.opendata.ch/), we would like to look back at our activities and highlights over the past 10 years. This review serves as documentation, inspiration and basis for the next 10 years of Opendata.ch in Switzerland. Thank you all for joining us on this journey for an open, innovative and fair society.

This project is designed by @lucguillemot and maintained by the Opendata.ch team on Vercel.

## Svelte Starter

This website is based on [The Pudding](https://pudding.cool)'s [starter template](https://github.com/the-pudding/svelte-starter) that aims to quickly scaffold a [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) project, designed around data-driven, visual stories.

## Maintenance notes

Use the `pnpm` package manager as follows to keep dependencies updated between releases:
